Effect of varying Branch Prediction Parameters on SPEC Benchmarks

## Description
- Simulated different branch predictors (2bit, bi-mode and tournament) on differnt SPEC benchmarks using the Gem5 computer system simulator
- Automated the simulaiton process using python scripts
- Observed and studied the simualtion results to calculate results like *Branch Misprediction Percentage* and *BTB miss percentage*, to find the best branch predictor
